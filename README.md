# Forge Bulk Issue Ops

# Introduction

This is a [Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge) app that provides alternate experiences to Jira's built-in functionality to bulk move and edit issues. 

The motivation behind the creation of the app was to constrain bulk work item operations to ensure an organisations practices are adhered to. Specific features of the app include:

* Policy level configuration controlling whether work items can be moved across project category boundaries;
* Ability to include logic specifying the allow target rojects of a move operation based on the selected work items; and
* Ability to include logic to restrict which work item fields are editable.


## Setup

See [Set up Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/set-up-forge/) for instructions to get set up.

### Setup step 1: Installing the app

The following are brief instructions to set up the app. For detailed instructions, visit https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/getting-started/.

- Register the app as your own:
```
cd [app-root-directory]
npm install
```

- Install app dependencies (backend and frontend):
```
cd [app-root-directory]
npm install
cd static/spa
npm install
```

- Build your app's frontend:
```
cd [app-root-directory]
cd static/spa
npm run build
```

- Deploy your app by running:
```
cd [app-root-directory]
forge deploy
```

- Install your app in an Atlassian site by running:
```
cd [app-root-directory]
forge install
```

### Setup step 2: Enable the app to perform bulk operations

Jira provides a global permission, called "Make bulk changes", to enable/disable the ability for users to make bulk changes. The standard configuration includes various roles, but administrators may change which roles are able to make bulk changes. To ensure the app continues to work, it is recommended that a role specific to the app be created and added to the "Make bulk changes" permission so that its purpose and association with the app is obvious.

1. Create a group called "bulk-ops-app" as follows:
* Click "User management" from the settings (cog) menu.
* Click "Directory" and "Groups".
* Click the "Create group" button.
* Enter "bulk-ops-app" and the group name.
* Click "Create" to create the group.

2. Add the "bulk-ops-app" group to the "Make bulk changes" global permission as follows:
* Visit Jira admin settings (https://your-tenant.atlassian.net/jira/settings/system/general-configuration).
* Visit "Global permissions" within the "Security" section.
* In the "Grant Permission" section, select "Grant: Make bulk changes: and "Group: bulk-ops-app". 

Once this is done, you should see the "bulk-ops-app" appear alongside the "Make bulk changes" global permission. When testing the app, it is recommended for this to be the only permission, but in a production environment, you will likely also want to allow administrators to have bulk change permissions.

### Setup step 3: Configure environment variables

In order for the app to be able to make bulk changes as the user requeting the changes, the app needs to add the requesting user into the "bulk-ops-app" group before the request is submitted and then remove the user from the group afterwards. Details about these environment variables are provided in [src/userManagementConfig.ts](./src/userManagementConfig.ts). To configure them:

1. Copy `scripts/setup-forge-environment-template` to `setup-forge-[env]-environment-private.sh` where `[env]` refers to one of your environments. An example would be `setup-forge-development-environment-private.sh`. Note that the `-private` part of the file name is necessary to prevent the file being checked into GIT and consequently disclosing private information.
2. Replace the values within `setup-forge-[env]-environment-private.sh` within square brackets with values for your configuration.
3. Run `./scripts/setup-forge-[env]-environment-private.sh`.

### Stepup step 4: Optionally prevent regular users from using Jira's built-in bulk operations

This optional step involves reviewing and tuning the access to Jira's built-in bulk operations. Visit the Jira administration global permissions section, and review the permissions corresponding to "Make bulk changes".

### Development Loop

- Run all forge commands from the `[app-root-directory]`.
- After making changes to the frontend, run `npm run start` from the `[app-root-directory]/static/spa` directory.
- Use the `forge deploy` command when you want to persist code changes or after you make changes to the app manifest.
- Use the `forge install` command when you want to install the app on a new site.
- Once the app is installed on a site, the site picks up the new app changes you deploy without needing to rerun the install command.

You can use the `./scripts/build-and-deploy.sh` to build and deploy the app as per the following examples:

```
./scripts/build-and-deploy.sh
./scripts/build-and-deploy.sh production
```

# Customisation

The app is designed to be support tailoring to an organisation's specific needs, but this requires code changes. There are several public functions in `static/spa/extension/bulkOperationRuleEnforcer.ts` that are designed for orgaisations to inject their own logic. When adding custom logic, it is recommended to keep code within the `static/spa/extension` directory to keep it isolated from the rest of the code.

Static configuration rules are defined as constants in `static/spa/extension/bulkOperationStaticRules.ts`.

# Additional configuration options

Configuration options can be defined in [static/spa/src/model/config.ts](static/spa/src/model/config.ts), but be careful modifying these options.

# Known issues

Where possible, known issues are documented in the relevant locations in the code. To address the known issues, start by searching the code base for the known issue key.

* KNOWN-1: The deprecated [Get create issue metadata API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issues/#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get) is being used, however, there seems to be no follow through of this deprecation.
* KNOWN-2: The `REMOVE` option is not supported when bulk editing labels.
* KNOWN-3: Labels can not be created within the bulk edit form.
* KNOWN-4: Bulk comment editing only supports plain text where each new line is represented as a new paragraph.
* KNOWN-5: Not all fields types are supported since each type of field requires custom UI to edit it.
* KNOWN-6: Rich text fields in bulk move operations only supports plain text where each new line is represented as a new paragraph.
* KNOWN-7: Bulk move operations only allow values to be specified for required custom fields.
* KNOWN-8: Only a limited set of field types are supported for default values in bulk move operations.
* KNOWN-9: Add the ability for issue type mappings to be restricted.
* KNOWN-10: In bulk move, when multiple projects are selected, subsequent steps are still passing.
* KNOWN-11: No monitoring of users accidentally left in the bulk-ops group.
* KNOWN-12: The app does not provide a dark mode view.
